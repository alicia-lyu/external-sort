## Randomly generate data

- Input data should be a continuous stream, no special character for splitting.
- [How to efficiently generate bytes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25298585/efficiently-generating-random-bytes-of-data-in-c11-14)
- Every byte should be alphanumeric.
- Should be stored in input.txt
- Ensure duplicates are present

Project oral discussion: Meet with TA and discuss about the project. Should have most of the implementation ready the last week of April.
